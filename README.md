# Expose job posting dates across major tech companies

Most job boards deliberately hide when roles were actually published, 
which makes it hard to know if you're looking at a fresh opportunity 
or something that's been sitting there for ages (seriously, who wants to apply for a role posted 756 centuries ago?).  
This project pulls the real posting dates from companies' underlying ***Greenhouse*** and ***Lever*** data, 
so you can make better decisions before applying and stop wasting time on ghost jobs.

**Note: This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the companies or job platforms mentioned. 
It simply uses their public job board endpoints. Use responsibly.**

## What's Inside

### ðŸŽ¯ **Single Company Scrapers**
Perfect for targeted searches with user input:
- **Greenhouse scraper**: Works with Stripe, Lyft, and other Greenhouse-powered boards
- **Lever scraper**: Works with Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, and other Lever-powered boards

### ðŸš€ **Batch Scrapers** 
The heavy hitters - scrape multiple companies automatically:
- **Greenhouse batch**: 10 visa-friendly companies (Stripe, GitLab, Coinbase, DoorDash, etc.)
- **Lever batch**: 10 global/remote-first companies (Netflix, Spotify, Figma, Discord, etc.)

All scrapers are optimized for locations like Canada, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, UK, Netherlands, and remote opportunities - basically anywhere that's not a visa nightmare.

## Features

- Extracts job listings directly from company job boards
- Aggressively hunts down hidden `published_at` and `createdAt` fields 
- Saves results into clean CSV files for easy sorting/filtering
- **Batch processing**: Scrape 20+ companies in one go
- **Individual CSVs**: Each company gets its own file for better organization
- **Smart filtering**: Only grabs engineering roles in target locations
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful delays to avoid getting blocked
- **Fallback strategies**: Multiple approaches to extract dates when companies try to hide them

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (tested on Python 3.10)
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

### Single Company Scraping
```bash
python greenhouse_scraper.py  # Interactive - choose Stripe, Lyft, etc.
python lever_scraper.py       # Interactive - choose Netflix, Spotify, etc.
```

### Batch Scraping (Recommended)
```bash
python greenhouse_batch_scraper.py  # Scrapes all 10 Greenhouse companies
python lever_batch_scraper.py       # Scrapes all 10 Lever companies
```

Results will be written to:
- `[platform]_[company]_jobs.csv` for individual companies
- Combine them all with the pro tips shown in the output

There are other mega-robust scrapers repo doing sort of the same thing as this one,
but not much attention is given to extracting the actual posting dates. If you can help
with this, you are more than welcomed to make a PR.
